Conversation Anatomy Framework
A systematic model for analyzing the structure and dynamics of intelligent dialogue. It dissects conversations across six fundamental dimensions



 - from how ideas interact between minds to the power dynamics at play - providing a comprehensive lens for understanding how communication actually works. Like anatomical study reveals how bodies function, this framework reveals the underlying mechanics of how people exchange meaning.



 **Conversation Anatomy Framework**

1. **Dialogic Functions** - How thoughts move between minds
   - Challenging Ideas
   - Explaining Concepts
   - Sharing Experiences
   - Co-creating Ideas
   - Affirming Views

2. **Contextual Dimensions** - The environmental/relational frame
   - Time-based (past/present/future)
   - Relationship-based (formal/informal/intimate)
   - Setting-based (public/private/semi-private)
   - Purpose-based (transactional/relational/exploratory)
   - Mode-based (synchronous/asynchronous/mediated)

3. **Energy Dynamics** - The emotional/intensity flow
   - Escalating
   - De-escalating
   - Maintaining
   - Pulsing

4. **Information Density** - The depth/complexity level
   - Surface-level
   - Detailed
   - Technical
   - Abstract

5. **Power Distribution** - Who controls the conversation
   - Symmetric
   - Asymmetric
   - Rotating
   - Centralized

6. **Temporal Structure** - How the conversation unfolds in time
   - Linear
   - Circular
   - Branching
   - Fragmented
