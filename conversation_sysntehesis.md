Conversational Synthesisâ€”not just analyzing existing conversations but designing new ones from scratch:

Goal Specification: Define desired outcome in dimensional terms
Trajectory Planning: Plot optimal path through conversation space
Constraint Satisfaction: Respect participant limitations and context
Real-time Correction: Adjust trajectory based on actual dimensional readings

Imagine a "Conversation Composer" tool where you could literally design a conversation like composing music, specifying how each dimension should evolve over time to achieve specific outcomes.
