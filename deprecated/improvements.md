Power Distribution might need more nuance. Power can be multi-dimensional itself - someone might control the topic while another controls the emotional tone. A therapist has professional power but deliberately cedes conversational control. Perhaps this needs sub-dimensions?


Extensions Worth Considering
Conversation Phase Transitions: Like matter changing states, conversations seem to undergo phase transitions - the moment a casual chat becomes an argument, or when professional discussion shifts to personal connection. These transitions might follow predictable patterns.
Attractor States: Certain conversation configurations might be stable attractors that discussions naturally evolve toward - like how arguments often converge to similar patterns regardless of starting topic.
Conservation Laws: You mention this need - I wonder if there's something like "total conversation energy" that remains constant but transforms between dimensions. High information density might necessarily reduce energy dynamics, for instance.



One question: Have you considered that conversations might not just exist on a manifold but might actually be the process by which we explore and map social/cognitive manifolds? Each conversation could be a probe into the space of possible thoughts and relationships.
