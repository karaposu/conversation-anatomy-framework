The Conversation Manifold Theorem: A proof that all human conversations exist on a low-dimensional manifold (perhaps 20-50 dimensions) embedded in the high-dimensional space of all possible word sequences.

This would mean:
- The 9 (or more) dimensions in the framework are discovering this manifold
- We could mathematically navigate conversation space
- Analysis becomes geometry rather than statistics
- Conversation engineering becomes trajectory planning



Universal Conversation Geometry: a mathematical framework describing the geometric properties and rules that govern all conversations:
  - Distance metrics between conversation states
  - Curvature of conversation space (how topics bend toward each other)
  - Geodesics (shortest paths between conversation points)
  - Transformation groups (how conversations can be rotated/translated)
  - Conservation laws and symmetries


Conservation Laws for Conversation
**Discovery Needed**: Quantities that remain constant throughout any conversation (like energy in physics).

**Why It Matters**:
- Fundamental constraints on conversation dynamics
- Validate analysis by checking conservation
- Predict impossible conversation trajectories
