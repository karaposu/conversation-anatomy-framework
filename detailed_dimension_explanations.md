## Detailed Dimension Explanations

### Dimension 1: Dialogic Functions

**Definition:** The cognitive-social actions taken with respect to content—how information transforms as it moves between minds.

**Core Functions:**
- **Challenging Ideas** - Questioning or opposing what's been said
- **Co-creating Ideas** - Building something new together
- **Explaining Concepts** - Teaching or clarifying information
- **Sharing Experiences** - Revealing personal stories or feelings
- **Affirming Views** - Supporting or validating what's been said
- **Transmitting** - Transferring existing information
- **Querying** - Requesting information
- **Echoing** - Reflecting or confirming

**Key Insight:** These functions often blend. A single statement like "When I tried that approach, it failed" simultaneously challenges an idea and shares experience. This ambiguity isn't a flaw—it's how real conversation works. Our framework preserves this richness rather than forcing artificial categorization.

### Dimension 2: Conversational Intent

**Definition:** The underlying purpose driving the exchange—what participants hope to achieve through conversation.

**Intent Layers:**
- **Surface intent**: What participants claim they want
- **Deeper intent**: Underlying goals they may not articulate
- **Emergent intent**: New purposes arising during conversation

**Common Intents:**
Convince, Influence, Manipulate, Teach, Inform, Clarify, Connect, Bond, Comfort, Negotiate, Request, Exchange, Discover, Brainstorm, Investigate, Entertain, Play, Enjoy

**Key Insight:** Intent often shifts mid-conversation. Someone might begin with "Inform" intent but shift to "Convince" when met with resistance. These transitions reveal conversational strategy.

### Dimension 3: Contextual Dimensions

**Definition:** The environmental and relational frame shaping what can be said, how it's interpreted, and what outcomes are possible.

**Context Types:**
- **Time-based**: Past-focused (reminiscing), present-focused (immediate), future-focused (planning)
- **Relationship-based**: Formal (hierarchy), informal (peers), intimate (close bonds)
- **Setting-based**: Public (performative), private (genuine), semi-private (selective)
- **Purpose-based**: Transactional (goal-oriented), relational (connection-focused), exploratory (discovery)
- **Mode-based**: Synchronous (real-time), asynchronous (delayed), mediated (translated)

**Key Insight:** Context acts as an invisible filter, determining not just what's appropriate but what's even conceivable within the conversation.

### Dimension 4: Energy Dynamics

**Definition:** The emotional intensity and flow throughout the conversation—the force and feeling behind words.

**Energy Patterns:**
- **Escalating**: Building intensity (positive excitement or negative anger)
- **De-escalating**: Reducing intensity, calming
- **Maintaining**: Steady energy level
- **Pulsing**: Rhythmic variation between high and low

**Key Insight:** Energy dynamics often predict outcomes more than content. Factually correct statements with escalating negative energy destroy relationships, while flawed arguments with positive steady energy build bonds.

### Dimension 5: Information Density

**Definition:** The depth and complexity of content—conceptual richness per unit of conversation.

**Density Levels:**
- **Surface-level**: Small talk, pleasantries, obvious observations
- **Detailed**: Specific facts, elaborated stories, nuanced descriptions
- **Technical**: Specialized knowledge, jargon, expert content
- **Abstract**: Philosophical concepts, theoretical frameworks, meta-discussions

**Key Insight:** Effective communication requires matched density between participants. Mismatched density (technical speaking meeting emotional seeking) creates friction.

### Dimension 6: Power Distribution

**Definition:** Who controls the conversation's direction, pace, and outcomes—influence over conversational flow.

**Distribution Patterns:**
- **Symmetric**: Equal control, balanced contribution
- **Asymmetric**: One party dominates
- **Rotating**: Control shifts between participants
- **Centralized**: One person acts as hub

**Key Insight:** Conversational power often differs from official hierarchy. A junior employee might control through expertise, a child through emotional influence.

### Dimension 7: Temporal Structure

**Definition:** How conversation unfolds through time—its narrative architecture and progression patterns.

**Temporal Patterns:**
- **Linear**: Point A to B to C, logical progression
- **Circular**: Returning to themes repeatedly
- **Branching**: Multiple parallel threads
- **Fragmented**: Disconnected topic jumps

**Key Insight:** Structure reveals thinking patterns. Linear suggests goal-orientation, circular might indicate processing trauma, branching shows associative thinking, fragmented signals distraction.

### Dimension 8: Engagement Level

**Definition:** Desire to participate in the conversation—willingness to be in the exchange itself.

**Engagement Spectrum:**
- **Highly engaged**: Actively wants to participate
- **Actively participating**: Present and contributing
- **Going through motions**: Obligatory participation
- **Reluctant participation**: Would prefer not to be there
- **Attempting to disengage**: Actively trying to leave

**Key Insight:** Low engagement flattens all other dimensions. It reduces energy, lowers information density, and creates power asymmetry as participants seek exit.

### Dimension 9: Interest Level

**Definition:** Genuine curiosity and attention to content—how much participants care about the discussion.

**Interest Spectrum:**
- **Deeply interested**: Absorbed in topic
- **Moderately curious**: Genuine but limited interest
- **Politely attentive**: Feigning interest from courtesy
- **Indifferent**: No emotional investment
- **Actively bored**: Finding content tedious

**Key Insight:** Interest and engagement are distinct. Someone can be fascinated (high interest) but need to leave (low engagement), or bored (low interest) but committed to participating (high engagement).
